# sureuv
SureUV addon for Blender

This addon creates UV coordinates using Box-method and Best Planar projection for selected polygons. For non-square textures script calculates proper proportion, so there will be no texture stretching. You can specify the exact size of the texture on the object. For the texture image its width will be exactly Size.

SureUV is very useful for fast architectural texturing.
